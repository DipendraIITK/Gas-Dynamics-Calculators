## About the Author

This project was created by **Dipendra Kumar Dewangan**, currently studying in the **Department of Aerospace Engineering, IIT Kanpur**. 

My interests include aerothermodynamics, propulsion, and computational simulations. This project combines fundamental gas dynamics theory with MATLAB programming to build practical engineering calculators for normal shocks, oblique shocks, and Prandtlâ€“Meyer expansion waves.  

Through this work, I aim to strengthen my understanding of compressible flow phenomena while showcasing my ability to 
translate theoretical equations into working computational tools. I am particularly motivated by research in low-emission 
combustion strategies and propulsion system analysis.
